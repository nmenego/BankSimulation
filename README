# Bank Simulation
A simulation of a bank with customer queues and tellers.


## Assumptions
1. Customers are only welcomed to the bank if time limit has not been reached. i..e. When time limit has been reached, we stop queueing new customers.
1. Waiting time is defined as time when customer stepped in until they finish the process.
1. End time is the time when customer finishes the process.
1. Customer types are constant throughout one simulation run.


## TODOs
1. Support multiple tellers
1. Support random customer types
1. Support being able to queue according to a capacity. 


## Execution
Project can be run as an IntelliJ project. Go to `BankSimulation > Run Main`.
